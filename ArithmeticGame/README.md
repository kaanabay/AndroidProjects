## Arithmetic Game

A basic game where players are expected to find the arithmetic operation (+,-,*,/) rather than the result.

The two operands and the result are presented. The operator is replaced by a question mark which you are expected to fill by clicking the buttons.

A correct answer is 1 point where a wrong answer cancels 2. The net score will be presented at the bottom.

I know that with this version the game is neither enjoyable nor competitive. I will try and implement a timer in v2. :)
